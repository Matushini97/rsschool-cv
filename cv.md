### **About me:**
I've started my way in development with educational platform https://stepik.org. I've finished "Python generation: Python for begginers" course there. During learning I realized that programming is attractive and intresting for me.

Then I came across RSSchool and decided to try Web Development.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
